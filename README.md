#  Expanding_cards
An interactive gallery of expanding image cards built with HTML5, CSS3, and plain JavaScript.

Overview
- Consists of multiple panels that expand on click, while other cards collapse — creating a clean, engaging interface 
- Inspired by Brad Traversy’s "50 Projects in 50 Days", demonstrating a modern, minimal UI

Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic structuring of the container and individual panels.
- CSS3 (Flexbox layout aligns cards fluidly. CSS transitions provide smooth expansion animations)
- JavaScript (ES6+). (Selects all panels, adds click event listeners, and toggles .active class to manage card states)

Features
- Interactive UI: Clicking a card expands it; others contract automatically.
- Smooth animations: Flex-grow transitions create a polished feel.
- Easy customization: Swap background images or panel titles to personalize the design.
